 *
 *	FFTerm allows dynamically generated command prompts when a command named
 *	"prompt" is hooked. This is that command, allowing the prompt to include the
 *	the current working directory.
 *
 *	@param	argc	The number of argument strings provided on the command line.
 *	@param	argc	An array of pointers, pointing to strings representing the command line arguments.
 *	@param	pEnv	Pointer to an FF_ENVIRONMENT object.
 *

/**
 *	You will see many of these tables after each command. They are optional.
 *	These tables simply provide descriptions of the commands to FFTerm.
 *	The first entry is always a generic error code (-1). The table is always NULL terminated.
 *
 *	The strings are used to provide meaningful messages to the user for various error codes.
 *	FFT_COMMAND_DESCRIPTION defines a command description, and is displayed via the help command.
