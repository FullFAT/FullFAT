I'd like to offer my extended thanks to all those who offered me advice and helped to me to test FullFAT over the past months.
\newline
\newline
Of notable mention:
\begin{itemize}
\item Adam Fullerton of Ardware LTD, nr Warminster, UK. See: www.ardware.co.uk.
\item Adam Hills, nr Bristol, UK. Thanks for listening to my ideas.
\item Daniel Walmsley, nr Newcastle, UK. Thanks bro!
\item Ruth Dellinger, nr Vienna, Austria. Thanks for being so patient.
\item Embedded Related's Newsgroup, Comp.Arch.Embedded. To all those who offered advice.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Unthanks!}
During the project I also received some really bad advice from someone on Embedded Related's newsgroup. I would like to place a special note of unthanks here, particular as this individual told me that FullFAT was a naive idea, and that I should drop the project at an early stage.

If you're writing a project and you encounter someone like this, don't let them get you down. Continue, strive, learn and complete, and you will create something unique and great.

Notable for ignorance, spite, and pure bad advice:
\begin{itemize}
\item Vladimir Vassilevsky - DSP and Mixed Signal Consultant of www.abvolt.com
\end{itemize}
