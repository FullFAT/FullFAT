\begin {abstract} 
FullFAT is a thread-safe FAT Filesystem driver for embedded systems. Written in a clear ANSI C style it compiles on almost any compiler, and provides simple to use abstractions allowing a developer to use FAT on any platform or environment. This paper aims to provide a clear and easy to understand manual for FullFAT, documenting all of its features, and providing simple examples. Also included is a list of other software by James Walmsley, that can aid integration of FullFAT into more advanced systems, and increase FullFAT's performance.
